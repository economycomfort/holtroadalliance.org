Neighbors met at [Marietta Coffee Company](https://mariettacoffeecompany.com) 
again on December 1, 2023 to discuss present state, recent actions, and proposed
next steps.

## Present State

## Recent Actions

## Next Steps
- Identify a name for the group (Holt Road Alliance!)
- Meeting with [Cobb DOT](https://cobbcounty.org/transportation) to discuss
ongoing projects around the Holt Road corridor.
- Explore viability of community outreach events, such as:
  - Sponsoring a [Walk To School](https://walkbiketoschool.org) day with the
  Wheeler and Eastvalley PTA, or similar.  Potentially walking from the schools
  to the [Sewell Mill Library](https://www.cobbcounty.org/parks/arts/sewell-mill-center)
  as an alternative.
  - Performing a walk audit.
- Incorporation of HRA as a 501c3 organization to enable sponsorship of things
such as [Adopt-a-mile](https://www.cobbcounty.org/keep-cobb-beautiful/litter-prevention),
and to enable private fundraising for small beautification projects, and HRA-branded
merchandise for community outreach.
- Commuinication improvements - move away from email, and to something better
suited for the task (such as the [HRA Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/holtroadalliance).
  - Acknowleging that Facebook isn't the ideal answer to this problem, but there
  is existing community involvement with some unrelated groups of neighbors, such
  as [Stronger East Marietta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/840621983333773/).
