<!--
Welcome!  Holt Road Alliance is an organization made up of neighbors with a
shared interest in improving the walkability and pedestrian safety along the
Holt Rd. corridor near Marietta, GA.

We aim to focus on issues such as crosswalk efficacy, sidewalk continuity,
general state of repair of existing sidewalks, and smaller beautification
efforts paid for through a combination of county, state, and private funding.

If you are one of our neighbors and interested in learning more, please get 
in touch with us on the [Connect]({{< ref "connect" >}}) page.
