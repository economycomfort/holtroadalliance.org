Holt Road Alliance (HRA) is an organization made up of neighbors with a
shared interest in improving the walkability and pedestrian safety along the
Holt Rd. corridor near Marietta, GA.

We aim to focus on issues such as crosswalk efficacy, sidewalk continuity,
general state of repair of existing sidewalks, and smaller beautification
efforts paid for through a combination of civic engagement combined with county, 
state, and private funding.

Presently, there is no official HRA board. However, general inquiries and 
requests to participate in future HRA meetings can be forwarded to 
[info@holtroadalliance.org](mailto:info@holtroadalliance.org), or by leveraging
the form on the [Connect]({{< ref "connect" >}}) page.

We would love to hear from you, especially if you are a neighbor in the general 
Holt Road/Sewell Mill/East Marietta area.
