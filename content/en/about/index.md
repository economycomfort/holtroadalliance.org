Holt Road Alliance (HRA) is a group of concerned neighbors who live along or 
near the Holt Rd. corridor in east Cobb County, GA. A common thread among HRA 
participants seems to largely stem around the deteriorating walkability of Holt 
Rd. and actions which could be taken to improve both pedestrian safety and 
mobility.

Holt Road Alliance aims to produce attainable change through civic engagement 
and regular communication with the Cobb County board of commissioners.

Presently, there is no official HRA board. However, general inquiries and 
requests to participate in future HRA meetings can be forwarded to 
[info@holtroadalliance.org](mailto:info@holtroadalliance.org), or by leveraging
the form on the [Contact Us]({{< ref "contact">}}) page.

We would love to hear from you, especially if you are a neighbor in the general 
Holt Road/Sewell Mill/East Marietta area.
